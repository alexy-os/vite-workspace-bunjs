# Proper Integration of Shadcn UI Components in a Monorepo

*"In the grand scheme of modern web development, one must approach component libraries with both elegance and pragmatism."*

## Philosophical Foundation

One ought to understand that the choice of ESM modules isn't merely a technical decision, but rather a fundamental architectural principle when working with BunJS. It's rather like choosing a proper tea blend - one must consider both tradition and efficiency.

## The Proper Way

### 1. Package Structure
*"A place for everything, and everything in its place."*

```typescript:packages/ui/vite.config.ts
import path from "path"
import { defineConfig } from "vite"

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/index.ts'),
      formats: ['es'],  // Mind the format, dear chap
      fileName: (format) => `ui.${format}.js`
    },
    cssCodeSplit: false,  // Quite essential for proper styling
    watch: {
      include: 'src/**'  // Keep a watchful eye
    }
  }
})
```

### 2. Proper Module Declaration
*"Clear intentions make for splendid implementations."*

```json:packages/ui/package.json
{
  "type": "module",  // Most crucial, indeed
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/ui.es.js",
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
    },
    "./styles": "./dist/ui.css"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices & Considerations

1. **Modular Integrity**
   - One must maintain proper separation of concerns
   - Each component should be self-contained, rather like a proper English garden

2. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript declarations are not merely suggestions, but rather fundamental guarantees
   - *"Type safety is not a destination, but a journey"*

3. **Style Management**
   - Tailwind configurations should be treated with the same respect as a well-brewed cup of Earl Grey
   - CSS modules must be properly scoped, much like the rooms in a Victorian mansion

## Warning Notes

> "One should be mindful that while CommonJS might seem familiar, ESM is the proper path forward with BunJS. Rather like the transition from horse-drawn carriages to motorcars - progress, dear boy, progress!"

## Proper Usage

```typescript:apps/app/src/main.tsx
import "@packages/ui/styles";  // Import with intention
```

## Concluding Thoughts

Remember, dear colleagues, that proper integration of Shadcn UI in a monorepo is not merely about making components work - it's about creating a sustainable, maintainable, and properly typed ecosystem. Rather like maintaining a proper English garden, it requires attention to detail, proper planning, and regular maintenance.

*"In the end, it's not just about the code we write, but the architecture we leave behind for future generations of developers."*
